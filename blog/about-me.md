## About me

Here I want to introduce myself just a *little* bit.

I am 20 years old, was born and live in Germany and I am a Coder. While I mainly do Full-Stack Webdevelopment as a hobby and as a job, I like to dip my feet in cold water as well, and explore all kinds of cool stuff. So over the years I did projects in C++, C#, Squirrel, NodeJS, HTML/CSS/JS/PHP and more, doing all sorts of things. I also explored **Anti Virus Evasion** a couple of years back and am also quite interested in **game hacking** to learn more about x86 Assembler, Windows PE's and code injection in general. Always fun to see how changing two instructions can mess up a whole game :)

Additionally, I am studying a lot of **XSS** at the moment.

Apart from all that coding stuff I also love to play Counter-Strike in all its iterations. If you wanna play a game or two add me on [Steam](https://blog.palone.top/).

For more serious topics or business write me a [mail](mailto:p410n3@gmail.com).

Have a nice day!
