## About me

I am 21 years old, was born and live in Germany and I am a Programmer.
While I mainly do Full-Stack Webdevelopment as a hobby and as a job, I
like to dip my feet in cold water as well, and explore all kinds of cool
stuff. So over the years I did projects in C++, C\#, Squirrel, NodeJS,
HTML/CSS/JS/PHP and more, doing all sorts of things. I also explored
Anti Virus Evasion a couple of years back and am also quite interested
in game hacking to learn more about x86 Assembler, Reverse
Enginnering and Security in general. Always fun to see how changing two
instructions can mess up a whole game :)

Additionally, I am a huge Linux fan and have used Linux exclusively on
my home devices for quite some time now. I was also running at least one
virtual private server for the last 5 years at any given time. My go-to
distro is Debian stable for servers and Debian sid/unstable for my
Desktop. But I also used Arch Linux, Manjaro, Ubuntu and Fedora in the
past.

Apart from all that tech stuff I also like to play Counter-Strike in all
its iterations. If you wanna play a game or two add me on
[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/palone).

You can also write me a [mail](mailto:p410n3@gmail.com).

Have a nice day!
